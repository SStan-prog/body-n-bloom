        <h3>How the Metabolic Balance® Weight Loss Diet Works</h3>
        <p>
          Metabolic Balance was developed from the knowledge that our daily food
          has an enormous influence on the body.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before making any nutritional recommendations, Metabolic Balance®
          requires a complete biochemistry (blood test) and health profile
          analysis. The personalized nutrition plan directs clients to supply
          their bodies with all the vital and healthy nutrients they need. Food
          is NOT selected according to calorie content or by a percentage of
          fat, protein, or carbohydrates. The criteria for food selection is
          based on the effect of specific foods on hormones and missing
          nutrients in the body. EVERY meal plan is individually tailored to the
          client's needs.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are no prescribed injections, pills, shakes, or proprietary
          foods. Nor are users required to keep “points” or count calories.
          Through this method, healthy and naturally balanced insulin production
          is promoted. Insulin is the “internal key” to the body’s weight
          management system and has a substantial effect on other hormonal and
          enzyme production.

          At Metabolic Balance, we believe that adequate food for the body
          should be as natural as possible. The more food has been processed,
          and the more additives have been added to it, the more likely it will
          negatively affect the body. This is why Metabolic Balance recommends
          local, natural, and organic foods that are as fresh as possible.
