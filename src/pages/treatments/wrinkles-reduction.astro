          Complete Facial Rejuvenation!<br />

          The eTwo system combines two unique Sublime™ and Sublative™
          applications in one desktop platform for skin ablation, resurfacing,
          and wrinkles.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sublative™ -Fractional radiofrequency (RF) initiates a strong wound
          healing response while minimizing the damage to the epidermis.
        </p>
        <p>
          It Is fractionated bi-polar RF technology uses heat energy to
          encourage significant increases of collagen and elastin in the upper
          dermis with low epidermal disruption for a broad range of skin types.
        </p>
        <p>
          Less affected tissue surrounding the matric point may be stimulated by
          heat, which helps accelerate the healing process leading to a
          smoother, rejuvenated appearance of the skin.
